    Calculates the patient's Creatinine Clearance and generates a detailed
    explanatory text.

    Parameters:
        params (dict): A dictionary containing the following key-value pairs:
            - "sex" (str): The patient's gender, which can be either "Male"
            or "Female".
            - "weight" (tuple): The patient's weight information in the
            format (value, unit).
                - Value (float): The numerical weight measurement.
                - Unit (str): The unit of weight, which can be "lbs" (
                pounds), "g" (grams), or "kg" (kilograms).
            - "height" (tuple): The patient's height information in the
            format (value, unit).
                - Value (float): The numerical height measurement.
                - Unit (str): The unit of height,
                which can be "cm" (centimeters) or "in" (inches).
            - "creatinine" (tuple): The patient's creatinine information in the
            format (value, unit).
                - Value (float): The value of creatinine.
                - Unit (str): The unit of creatinine,
                which can be "mg/dL", "Î¼mol/L", and so on.
            - "age" (array): The patient's albumin concentration in the
            format (value, unit).
                - Value (float): Age.
                - Unit (str): The unit can be "months", "years".

    Returns:
        dict: Contains two key-value pairs:
            - "Explanation" (str): A detailed description of
            the calculation process.
            - "Answer" (float): The patient's Creatinine Clearance.

    Notes:
        - Use the `weight_conversion_explanation` function to
        convert weight to kilogram.
        - Use the `bmi_calculator` function to calculate BMI.
        - Use the `ideal_body_weight` function to calculate Ideal Body
        Weight (IBW)

    Example:

        "weight": (55.0, "kg"),"height": (162.8, "cm"),
        "creatinine": (0.57, "mg/dL"),"age": (16, "years")})

        output: "{'Explanation': "The formula for computing Cockcroft-Gault

        gender_coefficient)) / (serum creatinine * 72), where the
        gender_coefficient is 1 if male, and 0.85 if female. The serum
        creatinine concentration is in mg/dL.\nThe patient's gender is
        female, which means that the gender coefficient is 0.85.\nThe
        patient is 16 years old. \nThe concentration of creatinine is 0.57
        mg/dL. \nThe formula for computing the patient's BMI is
        (weight)/(height * height), where weight is the patient's weight in
        kg and height is the patient's height in m. \nThe patient's height
        is 162.8 cm, which is 162.8 cm * 1 m / 100 cm = 1.628 m. The
        patient's weight is 55.0 kg. The patient's bmi is therefore 55.0 kg
        / (1.628 m * 1.628 m) = 20.752 kg/m^2. The patient's BMI is 20.8,
        indicating they are normal weight.\nBecause the patient is normal,
        we take minimum of the ideal body weight and the patient's body as
        the patient's adjusted weight for the Cockroft-Gault Equation.
        Hence, the adjusted body weight is the minimum of the two giving us
        an adjusted body weight of 54.918 kg.\n\nUsing the Cockcroft-Gault
        equation:\nCrCl = ((140 - age) * adjusted weight *
        gender_coefficient) / (serum creatinine * 72). \nPlugging the
        patient's values gives us ((140 - 16) * 54.918 * 0.85) /
