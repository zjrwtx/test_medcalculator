def hodges_calculator_explanation(input_variables):
    r"""
    Calculates the patient's corrected QT interval and generates a detailed
    explanatory text.

    Parameters:
        input_variables (dict): A dictionary containing the following
        key-value pairs:
            - "heart_rate" (tuple): The patient's heart rate in the format (
            value, unit).
                - Value (float): The value of the patient's heart rate.
                - Unit (str): The unit of heart rate should be "beats per
                minute".
            - "qt_interval" (tuple): The QT interval of 330 msec.
                - Value (float): The value of QT interval.
                - Unit (str): The unit of QT interval, "msec".

    Returns:
        dict: Contains two key-value pairs:
            - "Explanation" (str): A detailed description of
            the calculation process.
            - "Answer" (float): The patient's corrected QT interval.

    Notes:
        - None

    Example:
        hodges_calculator_explanation({"heart_rate": (52, "beats per
        minute"),"qt_interval": (330, "msec")})

        output: "{'Explanation': "The corrected QT interval using the Hodges
