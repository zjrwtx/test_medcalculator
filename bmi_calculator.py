    r"""
    Calculates the patient's BMI and generates a detailed explanatory text.

    Parameters:
        input_variables (dict): A dictionary containing the following
        key-value pairs:
            - "weight" (tuple): The patient's weight information in the
            format (value, unit).
                - Value (float): The numerical weight measurement.
                - Unit (str): The unit of weight, which can be "lbs" (
                pounds), "g" (grams), or "kg" (kilograms).
            - "height" (tuple): The patient's height information in the
            format (value, unit).
                - Value (float): The numerical height measurement.
                - Unit (str): The unit of height, which can be "cm" (
                centimeters) or "in" (inches).

    Returns:
        dict: Contains two key-value pairs:
            - "Explanation" (str): A detailed description of
            the calculation process.
            - "Answer" (float): The patient's BMI.

    Notes:
        - Uses the `height_conversion_explanation` function to convert
        height to inches.
        - Uses the `weight_conversion_explanation` function to convert
        weight to kilogram.

    Example:
        bmi_calculator_explanation({"weight": (150, "lbs"), "height": (170,
        "cm")})

        output: "{'Explanation': "The formula for computing the patient's
        BMI is (weight)/(height * height), where weight is the patient's
        weight in kg and height is the patient's height in m. \nThe
        patient's height is 170 cm, which is 170 cm * 1 m / 100 cm = 1.7 m.
        The patient's weight is 150 lbs so this converts to 150 lbs *
        0.453592 kg/lbs = 68.039 kg. The patient's bmi is therefore 68.039
        kg / (1.7 m * 1.7 m) = 23.543 kg/m^2.", 'Answer': 23.543}"
