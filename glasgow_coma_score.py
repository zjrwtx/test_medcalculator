def compute_glasgow_coma_score_explanation(input_variables):
    r"""
    Calculates the patient's Glasgow Coma Score and generates a detailed
    explanatory text.

    Parameters:
        input_variables (dict): A dictionary containing the following
        key-value pairs:
            - "insulin" (array): The patient's insulin level in the format (
            value, unit).
                - Value (float): The value of insulin level.
                - Unit (str): The unit of insulin level, eg. "ÂµIU/mL",
                "pmol/L", and so on.
            - "glucose" (array): The patient's blood glucose level in the
            format (value, unit).
                - Value (float): The value of blood glucose level.
                - Unit (str): The unit of blood glucose level,
                eg. "mmol/L", "mEq/L", and so on.

    Returns:
        dict: Contains two key-value pairs:
            - "Explanation" (str): A detailed description of
            the calculation process.
            - "Answer" (float): The patient's Homeostatic Model Assessment
            for Insulin Resistance.

    Notes:
        - None

    Example:
        compute_glasgow_coma_score_explanation({'insulin': [756.0, 'pmol/L'],
        'glucose': [97.3, 'mg/dL']})
