def mrdr_gfr_explanation(input_variables):
    r"""
    Calculates the patient's Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) and generates
    a detailed explanatory text.

    Parameters:
        input_variables (dict): A dictionary containing the following
        key-value pairs:
            - "age" (tuple): The patient's blood creatinine level in the
            format (value, unit).
                - Value (float): blood creatinine level.
                - Unit (str): The unit can be "mg/dL", "µmol/L", and so on.
            - "creatinine" (tuple): The patient's height information in the
            format (value, unit).
                - Value (float): The numerical height measurement.
                - Unit (str): The unit of height, which can be "cm" (
                centimeters) or "in" (inches).
            - "sex" (str): The patient's gender, which can be either "Male"
            or "Female".

    Returns:
        dict: Contains two key-value pairs:
            - "Explanation" (str): A detailed description of
            the calculation process.
            - "Answer" (float): The patient's Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR).

    Notes:
        - Uses the `conversion_explanation` function to convert source unit
        to target unit.

    Example:
        mrdr_gfr_explanation({"age": (49, 'years'),
        "creatinine": (10.6, 'mg/dL'),"sex": "Male"})

        output: "{'Explanation': "The patient is 49 years old. The
        concentration of Creatinine is 10.6 mg/dL. \nThe race of
        the patient is not provided, so the default value of the race
        coefficient is 1.0. \nThe patient is male, so the
        gender coefficient is 1.\nThe patient's estimated GFR is calculated
        using the MDRD equation as: \nGFR = 175 * creatinine^(-1.154) *
        age^(-0.203) * race_coefficient * gender_coefficient.
        The creatinine concentration is mg/dL.\nPlugging in these values
        will give us: 175 * 10.6^(-1.154) * 49^(-0.203) * 1 * 1=5.209.
