    The Glasgow-Blatchford Score (GBS) for assessing the severity of 
    gastrointestinal bleeding is shown below:

       1. Hemoglobin level (g/dL): Enter value (norm: 12-17 g/dL)
       2. BUN level (mg/dL): Enter value (norm: 8-20 mg/dL)
       3. Initial systolic blood pressure (mm Hg): Enter value (norm: 
       100-120 mm Hg)
       4. Sex: Female = +1 point, Male = 0 points
       5. Heart rate â‰¥100: No = 0 points, Yes = +1 point
       6. Melena present: No = 0 points, Yes = +1 point
       7. Recent syncope: No = 0 points, Yes = +2 points
       8. Hepatic disease history: No = 0 points, Yes = +2 points
       9. Cardiac failure present: No = 0 points, Yes = +2 points
