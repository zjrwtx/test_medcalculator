def mean_arterial_pressure_explanation(input_variables):
    r"""
    Calculates the patient's mean arterial pressure and
    generates a detailed explanatory text.

    Parameters:
        input_variables (dict): A dictionary containing the following
        key-value pairs:
            - "sys_bp" (array): The patient's systolic blood pressure (
            value, unit).
                - Value (float): Systolic blood pressure.
                - Unit (str): The unit of systolic blood pressure,
                which can be 'mm hg'.
            - "dia_bp" (array): The patient's diastolic blood pressure (
            value, unit).
                - Value (float): Diastolic blood pressure.
                - Unit (str): The unit of diastolic blood pressure,
                which can be 'mm hg'.

    Returns:
        dict: Contains two key-value pairs:
            - "Explanation" (str): A detailed description of
            the calculation process.
            - "Answer" (float): The patient's mean arterial pressure.

    Notes:
        - None

    Example:
        mean_arterial_pressure_explanation({"sys_bp": [120.0, 'mm hg'],
        "dia_bp": [80.0, 'mm hg']})

        output: "{'Explanation': "The mean average pressure is computed by
        the formula 2/3 * (diastolic blood pressure) + 1/3 *
        (systolic blood pressure). Plugging in the values,
        we get 2/3 * 80.0 mm Hg + 1/3 * 120.0 mm Hg = 93.333 mm Hg.
