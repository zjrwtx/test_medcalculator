def abw_explanation(input_variables):
    r"""
    Calculates the patient's Adjusted Body Weight (ABW) and generates a
        detailed explanatory text.

    Parameters:
        input_variables (dict): A dictionary containing the following
            key-value pairs:
            - "weight" (tuple): The patient's weight information in the format
                (value, unit).
                - Value (float): The numerical weight measurement.
                - Unit (str): The unit of weight, which can be "lbs" (pounds),
                    "g" (grams), or "kg" (kilograms).
            - "height" (tuple): The patient's height information in the format
                (value, unit).
                - Value (float): The numerical height measurement.
                - Unit (str): The unit of height, which can be "cm"
                    (centimeters) or "in" (inches).
            - "sex" (str): The patient's gender, which can be either "Male"
                or "Female".

    Returns:
        dict: Contains three key-value pairs:
            - "Explanation" (str): A detailed description of the calculation
                process, including IBW and ABW calculations.
            - "ABW" (str): The specific formula and result for ABW calculation.
            - "Answer" (float): The patient's adjusted body weight
                (in kilograms).

    Notes:
        - Uses the `weight_conversion.weight_conversion_explanation` function
            to convert weight to kilograms.
        - Uses the `ideal_body_weight.ibw_explanation` function to calculate
            Ideal Body Weight (IBW).
        - Uses the `round_number` function to round the result.

    Example:
        abw_explanation({'weight': (150, 'lbs'),
            'height': (170, 'cm'), 'sex': 'Male'})
        output: "{'Explanation': "The patient's gender
            is Male.\nThe patient's height is 170 cm,
            which is 170 cm * 0.393701 in/cm = 66.929
        in. \nFor males, the ideal body weight (IBW) is calculated as follows:
            \nIBW = 50 kg + 2.3 kg * (height (in inches) - 60)\nPlugging
        in the values gives us 50 kg + 2.3 kg * (66.929 (in inches) - 60)
            = 65.937 kg.\nHence, the patient's IBW is 65.937 kg.The
        patient's weight is 150 lbs so this converts to 150 lbs * 0.453592
            kg/lbs = 68.039 kg. To compute the ABW value, apply the
        following formula: ABW = IBW + 0.4 * (weight (in kg) - IBW (in kg)).
            ABW = 65.937 kg + 0.4 * (68.039 kg  -
        65.937 kg) = 66.778 kg. The patient's adjusted body weight is
